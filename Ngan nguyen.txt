	<h1>Project Proposal - Health Care Devices: Detecting Fake or Real Medicine</h1>
	
	<h2>Topic Description</h2>
	<p>In this project, our team aims to investigate health care devices that can detect fake or real medicine. With the rise of counterfeit drugs in the market, it has become crucial to develop technologies that can ensure patient safety and the effectiveness of medication. We will explore different techniques and technologies used in the identification and verification of medicine authenticity.</p>
	
	<h2>Relevance and Importance</h2>
	<p>The issue of counterfeit medicine poses significant risks to public health. Fake drugs can have harmful or ineffective substances, leading to adverse effects or treatment failures. By focusing on health care devices for detecting fake or real medicine, our project aims to contribute to the improvement of drug quality control and patient safety. It aligns with the growing need for reliable and efficient methods to combat counterfeit pharmaceuticals.</p>
	
	<h2>Reason for Choosing the Topic</h2>
	<p>We chose this topic because of its relevance and potential impact on society. The proliferation of counterfeit medicine is a global concern, and we believe that by exploring health care devices and their ability to detect fake or real medicine, we can contribute to raising awareness and developing effective solutions to tackle this issue.</p>
