<h1>Digital Topic: Combating Counterfeit medicines</h1>
<p>(This website have been modified by Ngan Nguyen, and Thomas Nguyen)</p>


</ul><p>The spread of counterfeit drugs and medicines is a serious threat
  to public health and safety. These counterfeit products not only fail
  to provide the intended medical benefits, but they can also cause severe
  adverse effects and even death. As a result, developing a robust system
  for detecting and preventing the distribution of counterfeit drugs is
  critical. Examining the benefits, drawbacks, practical applications,
  and overall impact of systems used to spot fake drugs and medications
  is the aim of this portfolio.</p>
