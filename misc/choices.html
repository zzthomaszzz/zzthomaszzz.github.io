</ul><h4><p>Counterfeiters' Choices<p></h4>
<p>Regulatory Authorities: Regulatory authorities are essential  in the fight against the sale of fake medicines. They are in charge of making and enforcing
  laws to safeguard the health and safety of the general public. The main practical applications for regulatory authorities include bolstering legal frameworks,
  investing in the development of regulatory capacity, and fostering international cooperation. Regulatory authorities can impose penalties and sanctions on
  manufacturers and distributors of counterfeit drugs by enacting strict laws and regulations. These legal frameworks serve as deterrents and make it abundantly
  clear that activities involving counterfeit drugs will not  be accepted. Investigations into and prosecution of people or groups involved in the production of
  counterfeit drugs may be conducted by regulatory authorities in conjunction with law enforcement.
  Regulation agencies can also invest in capacity- building projects to improve their capacity to identify and stop the sale of fake medicines. Training
  regulatory staff in cutting-edge authentication technologies, supply chain monitoring, and investigative methods is part of this. Regulatory authorities
  global trade in fake medicines, international cooperation is essential. To share information, swap best practices, and harmonize regulations, regulatory
  authorities can work with their counterparts in other nations.  By enhancing efforts to identify and stop the transnational distribution of fake drugs,
  this collaboration makes it harder for counterfeiters to take advantage of jurisdictional disparities.
  <br>In conclusion, there  are numerous stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry that can use the practical applications of spotting fake drugs and
  medications. The authenticity and safety of medications are all assured by pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacies, retailers and regulatory
  agencies. These parties can jointly fight the trade in fake medicines by putting authentication technologies, track and trace systems, and regulatory
  measures into place. The use cases described in this portfolio are intended to improve market integrity, consumer trust, and public health, ultimately
  shielding people from the harmful effects of fake medicines. Counterfeiters will either have to spend more money on improving their counterfeit medicines which is also not plausible
  because the cost of mass production will raise the market prices of them which would make them potentially cost more than real medicines.
