<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>A comprehensive system that combines authentication technologies, supply chain monitoring and regulatory measures is needed to detect fake drugs and medications.<p></h4>
<p>The system has some notable advantages, such as sophisticated  packaging, track and trace systems and legal frameworks.
  Pharmaceutical producers, wholesale, retailers and regulatory agencies can all use practical applications. The system
  is significantly more effective overall, enhancing consumer confidence, market integrity and public health. In order to
  stay one step ahead of counterfeiters and guarantee the safety of patients everywhere, ongoing collaboration and
  innovation are very crucial. Pharmaceutical Companies: The authenticity and safety of pharmaceutical products are crucially
  dependent on pharmaceutical manufacturers. Manufacturers can effectively manage their systems by integrating serialization
  and track and trace technologies. Manufacturers can track a productâ€™s journey from production to distribution by giving
  each one a special identification number. They can quickly recognize and look into potential counterfeit drugs in the event
   of any suspicious activity or unauthorized handling. Additionally, manufacturers can work with suppliers of authentication
   technology to incorporate cutting-edge packaging features like holograms, tamper-evident seals, or color-shifting inks.
  These characteristics make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate the packaging, making it simpler to distinguish between
  real and fake drugs. Pharmaceutical companies can protect their brand reputation and guarantee consumers' safety and wellbeing
  by putting these measures in place </p>
