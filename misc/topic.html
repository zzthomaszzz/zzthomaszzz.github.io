<h1>Combating Counterfeit Medicines</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The spread of counterfeit drugs and medicines is a serious threat
  to public health and safety. These counterfeit products not only fail to
  provide the intended medical benefits, but they can also cause severe adverse
  effects and even death. As a result, developing a robust system for detecting
  and preventing the distribution of counterfeit drugs is critical. Examining
  the benefits, drawbacks, practical applications, and overall impact of systems
  used to spot fake drugs and medications is the aim of this portfolio.<p></h5>

<h3>Review of the system</h3>
<p>A multifaceted strategy combining technology, regulation, and cooperation
  among various stakeholders is required for the detection of fake drugs and
  medications. Regulatory controls, supply chain monitoring, and authentication
  technologies make up the three main parts of this system.</p>
